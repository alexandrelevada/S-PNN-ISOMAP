# A Supervised Probabilistic Nearest Neighbors Isometric Feature Mapping for Dimensionality Reduction Based Metric Learning

Isometric Feature Mapping (ISOMAP) is a widely used nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique that preserves manifold geometry by approximating geodesic distances on a neighborhood graph. However, its performance is highly sensitive to the choice of metric used to define graph edges, with the conventional Euclidean distance often failing to capture intrinsic structures in high-dimensional, noisy, or unevenly sampled data. In this work, we propose Probabilistic Nearest Neighbors ISOMAP (PNN-ISOMAP), a supervised metric learning framework that enhances ISOMAP by replacing fixed Euclidean edge weights with probabilistic similarity measures derived from local data distributions. This formulation encodes the likelihood of neighborhood membership, adaptively capturing local geometry while reducing distortions from outliers, curvature, and density variations. To incorporate supervision, edges connecting samples from different classes are penalized by a hybrid weighting scheme that integrates both Euclidean and probabilistic distances. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that PNN-ISOMAP yields superior class separability compared to classical supervised approaches such as Supervised PCA, Partial Least Squares, and Linear Discriminant Analysis, while achieving performance comparable to or exceeding that of the state-of-the-art Supervised UMAP. These results highlight probabilistic neighborhood modeling as a principled strategy for advancing graph-based manifold learning.
